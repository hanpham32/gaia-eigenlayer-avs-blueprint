# <h1 align="center">Hello World Tangle Blueprint üåê</h1>

## üìö Overview

This Tangle Blueprint provides a simple Hello World job.
Blueprints are specifications for <abbr title="Actively Validated Services">AVS</abbr>s on the Tangle Network. An AVS is
an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.

Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures as if they were
smart contracts. This enables developers to monetize their work and align long-term incentives with the success of their
creations, benefiting proportionally to their Blueprint's usage.

For more details, please refer to the [project documentation](https://docs.tangle.tools/developers/blueprints/introduction).

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://docs.tangle.tools/developers/cli/installation)

You will also need to install [cargo-tangle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tangle), our CLI tool for creating and
deploying Tangle Blueprints:

To install the Tangle CLI, run the following command:

> Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --git https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget --force
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### To build the project:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### To deploy the blueprint to the Eigenlayer network

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint deploy eigenlayer \
    --devnet \
    --ordered-deployment
```

- **Pauser Registry**: The address is provided in the deployment output at the beginning of the logs.
- **Tangle Task Manager**: The address is generated during the deployment process and can be found in the deployment output.
- **Initial Owner**: This address has ownership privileges over the deployed contracts.
- **Aggregator**: Responsible for aggregating task responses.
- **Generator**: Used to create new tasks.
- **Registry Coordinator**: a smart contract responsible for managing the registration of operators in the EigenLayer ecosystem.
- **Stake Registry**: manages the staking mechanism for operators.
- **Rewards Coordinator**: manages rewarding mechanism for operators.

### To run the AVS

```bash
TASK_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x07882Ae1ecB7429a84f1D53048d35c4bB2056877 cargo tangle blueprint run \
    -p eigenlayer \
    -u <YOUR-RPC-URL:PORT> \
    --keystore-path ./test-keystore

```
